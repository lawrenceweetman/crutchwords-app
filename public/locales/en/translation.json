Fillers are a natural response to \"cognitive load\"—that moment your brain is busy planning its next thought.\n\nThis app isn't a critic; it's a coach. It helps you build awareness. By seeing your fillers in real-time, you can start to practice replacing them with a powerful, confident tool: the silent pause.\n\nReady to start practicing?",

    "transitions": "We often use 'so...' or 'um...' between big ideas. Try planning your transitions, even a simple 'Let's move on to...' can make a huge difference."
