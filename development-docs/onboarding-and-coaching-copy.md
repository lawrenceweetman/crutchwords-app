# **Onboarding & Coaching Copy**

This file provides all user-facing text for the "Fluent" app. This copy is derived from expert research and is designed to be encouraging, insightful, and supportive.

## **1\. Onboarding / Welcome Modal (First-Time Use)**

**Title:** Welcome to Fluent\!

Body:  
Ever wonder why we say "um" or "like"?  
It's not a "flaw." It's your brain working\! Fillers are a natural response to "cognitive load"—that moment your brain is busy planning its next thought.

This app isn't a critic; it's a coach. It helps you build _awareness_. By seeing your fillers in real-time, you can start to practice replacing them with a powerful, confident tool: **the silent pause.**

## **2\. In-App Coaching Tips**

(These can be displayed as "tips of the day" on the dashboard or as dismissible alerts.)

- **Tip (The Pause):** "Feeling the urge to say 'um'? Try this: just **pause**. A moment of silence gives your brain time to catch up and makes you sound more confident."
- **Tip (Pacing):** "Fillers often happen when your mouth outpaces your mind. Try **slowing down** just a little. It gives you more time to think and your audience more time to listen."
- **Tip (Awareness):** "The first step to breaking a habit is noticing it. This app helps you build that awareness. Don't judge the fillers—just notice them\!"
- **Tip (Anxiety):** "Feeling nervous? Nerves are a top cause of fillers. Before you start, take one deep 'belly breath.' It's a simple way to calm your system."
- **Tip (Transitions):** "We often use 'so...' or 'um...' between big ideas. Try planning your transitions, even a simple 'Let's move on to...' can make a huge difference."

## **3\. Post-Session Analysis / Dashboard Explanations**

When explaining the "Filler Density" (Fillers Per Minute):  
"This number helps you find your 'tipping point.' Research shows that a few fillers are natural, but too many can distract your audience. Use this to track your progress over time\!"  
When explaining the "Filler Categories":  
"Not all fillers are the same. Here's what your breakdown means:"

- **Filled Pauses (e.g., 'um', 'ah')**
  - **What it is:** This is the sound of your brain "buffering"—searching for the next word or idea.
  - **The Tactic:** This is the _perfect_ place to practice the **silent pause**.
- **Discourse Markers (e.g., 'like', 'so', 'actually')**
  - **What it is:** These are habitual "connector" words we use to structure our thoughts. They're not all bad, but they can clutter your message.
  - **The Tactic:** Awareness is key. Noticing _how often_ you use "like" is the first step to using it more intentionally.
- **Placating Tags (e.g., 'you know?', 'right?')**
  - **What it is:** These are often used to check for agreement or to soften a statement.
  - **The Tactic:** Try to speak with confidence. Turn "This is a good idea, right?" into "This is a good idea."
